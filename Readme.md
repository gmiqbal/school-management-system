# School Management System

A simple Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) based School Management System built using Java. The application keeps track of students, teachers, funds, student fees, and teacher salaries. This project is based on the tutorial [Build your first OOP application in Java with example - Building a School Management System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0X00EoFQbE).

## Features

- Manage Students (Add, Update, Pay Fees)
- Manage Teachers (Add, Update, Receive Salaries)
- Track School Finances (Total Money Earned and Spent)

## Classes

- `Student`: Represents a student, including their ID, name, grade, fees paid, and total fees.
- `Teacher`: Represents a teacher, including their ID, name, and salary.
- `School`: Manages lists of students and teachers, as well as the school's finances.

## Example Usage

To see the application in action, run the `Main.java` class. It demonstrates how to create students, teachers, and a school, as well as how to manage fees and salaries.

## Code Structure

The application is organized into the following Java classes:

- `Student.java`: Responsible for keeping track of a student's name, ID, grade, and fees paid.
- `Teacher.java`: Responsible for keeping track of a teacher's ID, name, and salary.
- `School.java`: Manages lists of students and teachers, and keeps track of the school's finances.
- `Main.java`: Demonstrates how to use the application.
